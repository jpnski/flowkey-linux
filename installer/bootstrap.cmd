::  Flowkey installer bootstrapper - double-clickable wrapper.
::
::  Calls bootstrap.ps1 with:
::    -ExecutionPolicy Bypass   (works regardless of system policy)
::    -NoProfile                (faster startup, ignores user $PROFILE)
::    -Build                    (chains through to actual installer build)
::
::  When this finishes successfully, the signed .exe is at:
::    out\Flowkey-Setup-<version>.exe
::
::  Pauses at the end so a double-click user can read the result.
